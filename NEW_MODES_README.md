## 🎬 Video Preview System

I've created a complete video preview system for you:

### Files Created:
1. **`generate_video_previews.py`** - Script to generate 3-second video previews of all modes
2. **`video_preview_viewer.html`** - Beautiful HTML gallery with hover-to-play video previews

### How to Use:

#### Step 1: Generate Video Previews
```bash
cd /Users/ahmeddoghri/Desktop/AudioSpectrum
python generate_video_previews.py
```

This will:
- Create a 3-second audio clip from your Turkish National Anthem (at the 10-second mark)
- Generate 3-second video previews for all 120+ modes
- Save them to `/Users/ahmeddoghri/Desktop/catalog/video_previews/`

#### Step 2: Open the HTML Viewer
```bash
open video_preview_viewer.html
```

The HTML viewer features:
- 🎥 **Hover-to-play** video previews (no clicking needed!)
- 🔍 **Live search** - search by name, description, or tags
- 🎯 **Smart filters** - All, Creative (100), Classic (10), Lines (10), or Hypnotic (51-100)
- ✨ **"NEW!" badges** on modes 51-100
- 🎨 **Beautiful gradient design** with smooth animations
- 📱 **Responsive** - works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Generate a Single Mode
```bash
# Try the new Fractal Tree mode (Mode 51)
python audio_spectrum_creative.py turkish-national-anthem.wav output.mov --mode 51

# Try the Gravity Well (Mode 53)
python audio_spectrum_creative.py turkish-national-anthem.wav output.mov --mode 53

# Try the Conway's Life (Mode 60)

```

### Generate Full Catalog
```bash
# This will now generate screenshots for ALL 100 creative modes!
python generate_catalog.py
```

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

Every new mode (51-100) was designed with **hypnosis** in mind:

### ✅ Hypnotic Elements Used:
1. **Smooth, flowing motion** - No harsh jumps or stutters
2. **Repetitive patterns** - Fractals, spirals, waves, tessellations
3. **Pulsing & breathing** - Organic growth and shrinking
4. **Symmetry & mirroring** - Kaleidoscopic effects
5. **Depth & 3D** - Tunnels, flyovers, orbital systems
6. **Particle systems** - Mesmerizing swarms, storms, physics
7. **Color gradients** - Smooth chromatic transitions
8. **Natural phenomena** - Fire, water, aurora, lightning
9. **Organic shapes** - Metaballs, jellyfish, vines, cells
10. **Mathematical beauty** - Spirographs, fractals, Voronoi

### 🎵 Audio Reactivity:
- **Bass (low freq)**: Controls large movements, main shapes, pulsing, spawning
- **Mids (mid freq)**: Controls colors, secondary effects, modulation
- **Treble (high freq)**: Controls shimmer, detail, sparkles, fast effects
- **Stereo (L/R)**: Controls direction, wind, camera pan in some modes
