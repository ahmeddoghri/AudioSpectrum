BROKEN MODES REPORT
Generated: 2025-11-20T06:48:38.283Z

Total broken modes: 0

DETAILED LIST:


EXPLANATION:
These modes all call renderPlaceholder() which renders a generic circular bars
visualization instead of their unique implementation. This occurred during the
migration from Python to JavaScript where the implementations were not completed.

IMPACT:
Multiple modes with different names and descriptions will look identical,
causing confusion for users.

RECOMMENDATION:
Each mode needs its unique render implementation based on its description
in the constants.js file.
